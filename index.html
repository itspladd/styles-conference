      in crafting horrifying, eerily lifelike simulacra of celebrity icon Harry Styles.</p>

      <h5>ARISEN SHALL BE THE PALACE OF STYLES FROM THE HUMBLED EARTH</h5>
      </a>
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to interference from the Unstyled, we have relocated our conference to Ballroom C of
        the iconic Four Seasons Hotel located at 12th and Lynwood.</p>
      <p><s>Aeons in the making, our Stylecerors have wrested from the planet's grasp an infinite mansion "Styled" after
          Harry himself. Visitors can now metaphorically AND literally get lost in Harry's eyes, swim in the depths of
          his soul, and sup upon his voice!</s></p>
